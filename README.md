 Udacity driving simulator has been used on lake track. for collecting training data.
The driving simulator would save frames from three front-facing “cameras”, recording data from the car’s point of view; as well as various driving statistics like throttle, speed, and steering angle. We are going to use camera data as model input and expect it to predict the steering angle.
