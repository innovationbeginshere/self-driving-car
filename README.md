# self-driving-car
 Udacity driving simulator has been used on lake track. for collecting training data.
The driving simulator would save frames from three front-facing “cameras”, recording data from the car’s point of view; as well as various driving statistics like throttle, speed, and steering angle. We are going to use camera data as model input and expect it to predict the steering angle.

below is the model structure for the project
